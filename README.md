# Langchain Roadmap
These notebooks will walk you through my entire process of learning langchain. It contains all the steps I had to go through to master my grip on implementing RAG pipelines from sratch.  

---------------
### Prerequisites
-----------

You will need to install Langchain for a start.

Notebooks specify rest of the requiremnets, including TogetherApi key.

### Notebook 1
-----------

* I tried to create simple chain to chat with model using prompt.
* Then I tried to maintain history of my conversation as well this time but couldn't pull it off. I was introduced to a new prblem named ``hallucination``.
* Figured how I could use prompt to directly do any task like summarize, translate from language to language etc.


### Notebook 2
-----------

* Here is whenre external sources are used when getting response from an LLM.
* Maintain history of your conversation as well this time
* Explore other tasks that can be done using learnt chains and prompts
